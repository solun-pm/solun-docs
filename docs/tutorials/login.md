# Login

<LoginImage imgSrc="/img/login_account.gif" />

Follow these steps to login to your account on **auth.solun.pm**:

1. Open your preferred web browser. This could be Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or any other.

2. In the address bar, type in '[auth.solun.pm](https://auth.solun.pm)' and press the enter key.

3. You will be directed to the login page of the website. Here you should see fields for your username and password.

4. Enter your Mail Address in the 'E-Mail Address' field. This should be the name you selected at sign up, including the domain suffix. For example, if you signed up as 'john' and selected 'solun.pm' as your domain suffix, you should type 'john@solun.pm' in the field.

5. Next, input your password in the 'Password' field.

6. Once you've filled in your username and password, click on the 'Login' button.

7. If your username and password are correct, you should now be logged in to the website and can begin using its services.

## Troubleshooting

Please note that some password managers may only store your username and not include the domain suffix. Therefore, always ensure that you have correctly included the domain suffix when logging in.

If you encounter any issues or forget your password, look for a 'Forgot your password?' link on the login page. [How to Recover your Account](/docs/tutorials/account-recovery).

If the issues persist, I recommend you to contact the website's help or support per mail to [support@solun.pm](mailto:support@solun.pm).
