# Enable/Disable Alias

You cant delete an Alias, but you can disable it. This will make the Alias unusable and you can enable it again later. Also we dont have the risk of someone else registering the Alias.

If you want to delete an Alias, you can contact us at [support@solun.pm](mailto:support@solun.pm) and we will delete it for you. To help us provide the best service, please tell us why you want to delete the Alias.

3. After you have logged in, click on the 'Aliases' button at the top of the page.
